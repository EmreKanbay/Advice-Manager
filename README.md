# Advice Manager

This is an app that lets you save advices and quotes that you have learned, and by that you can remember and do not forget them in future.

I needed it, so someone else will need too, thats the beauty of open source.

Real deal will be docker support, so everybody can host it pretty cheap on big cloud providers.
